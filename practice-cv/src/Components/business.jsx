                <p>Ever since I was a toddler I have been conducting business.
                    It started with countless flee markets and other local sales with my mom, introducing bargaining and being a salesman from a young age.
                    To earn money for the weekend candy I was sometimes selling old toys on the street with a friend.
                    I later used those skills on abroad trips for bargaining prices on most things, from souvenirs to cab rides. When getting my
                    driver license I could apply these skills to buying and selling cars.

                <h3>Bank and finance</h3>
                <p>My first bank job was a summer job in 2009 at Swedbank's current investment company called Swedbank Markets.
                    I returned there in winter 2009 for an internship during gymnasium.
                    When searching jobs in 2012 I ended up in Marginalen Bank where I worked in customer service until
                    early 2015 when I got promoted to the Products department, working with credit cards as a coordinator.
                    There I was in charge of campain offers and executions, also assisting in projects, partners, backoffice and customer service,
                    making sure deals went down properly.</p>
                <p>I started studying in 2016 but return to Marginalen Bank as a part time employee in 2017 until 2021. The first two summers
                    I filled in as the customer complaints representative dealing with cases that is not resolved by first instances.
                    After my studies in 2021 I started working for AddSecure with contracts and billing, also serving as 2nd line support,
                    until fall 2022 when I started pursuing a new career as a software developer.
