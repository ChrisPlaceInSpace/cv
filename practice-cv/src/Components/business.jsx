            <p>Ever since I was a toddler I have been conducting business.
                It started with countless flee markets and garage sales with my mom, introducing bargaining and being a salesman from young age. 
                To earn spare money and the weekend candy I was selling old toys on the street with friends.
                I later used those skills on abroad trips for bargaining prices on all from souvenirs to ride tickets. When getting my
                driver license I could apply this to buying and selling cars.
