                    <p className='text-straight'>Ever since I was a toddler I have been conducting business.
                        It started with countless flee markets and local sales with my mom, introducing bargaining and being a salesman from a young age.
                        To earn money for the weekend candy I sometimes went selling old toys on the street with friends.
                        I later used those skills on abroad trips for bargaining prices on things, from souvenirs to cab rides. When getting
                        a job within telemarketing in my late teens I could apply some of the same skills and quickly learned the process of selling over the phone.
                        Fast forward to the recent years (the 20's) where I started seeing the true power of online marketing and sales. I gathered information
                        from various sources and in 2024 I started my first e-commerce business with a friend, selling products online.

            <h3>Bank and finance</h3>
            <p>My first bank job was a summer job in 2009 at Swedbank's then current investment bank called Swedbank Markets.
                I returned there in winter 2009 for an internship during gymnasium.
                When searching jobs in 2012 I ended up in Marginalen Bank where I worked in customer service until
                early 2015 when I got promoted to the Products department, working with credit cards as a coordinator.
                There I was in charge of campain offers and executions, also assisting in projects, partners, backoffice and customer service,
                making sure deals went down properly.</p>
            <p>I started studying in 2016 but return to Marginalen Bank as a part time employee in 2017 until 2021. The first two summers
                I filled in as the customer complaints representative dealing with cases that is not resolved by first instances.
                After my studies in 2021 I started working for AddSecure with contracts and billing, also serving as 2nd line support,
                until fall 2022 when I started pursuing a new career as a software developer.
