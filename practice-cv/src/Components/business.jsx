                    <p>Ever since I was a toddler I have been conducting business.
                        It started with countless flee markets and local sales with my mother, introducing bargaining and being a salesman from a young age.
                        To earn money for the weekend candy I sometimes went outside selling old toys on the street with friends.
                        I later used and debeloped those skills on abroad trips for bargaining prices, from souvenirs to taxi rides. When getting
                        a job within telemarketing in my late teens I could apply some of the same skills and quickly learned the process of selling over the phone.
                        Fast forward to the recent years where I started seeing the true power of online marketing and sales. I gathered information
                        from various sources and in 2024 I started my first e-commerce business with a friend, selling products online.

                <p> A part of the program was UF, which is creating and running a business for a year as adolescents. I was head of sales.
                    We got awarded with a teachers choice price in our school and a top 3 price in the Stockholm region for the annual report.

            <h3>Bank and finance</h3>
            <p>My first bank job was a summer job in 2009 at Swedbank's then current investment bank called Swedbank Markets.
                I returned there in winter 2009 for an internship during the gymnasium program.
                After graduating, working a couple of years in telemarketing, in 2012 I started a new employment in Marginalen Bank where I worked in customer service until
                early 2015 when I got promoted to the Products department, working with credit cards as a coordinator.
                There I was in charge of campain follow-ups and executions, also assisting projects, partners, backoffice and customer service, 
                as well as educating and disributing information from chain in command.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>I started studying in 2016 while also moving to Spain, but I return to Sweden and Marginalen Bank in 2017 as a part time employee until 2021 while studying. 
                The first two summers I filled in as the customer complaints representative dealing with cases that is not resolved by first instances.
                After my studies in 2021 I started working for AddSecure with contracts and billing, also serving as 2nd line support,
                until fall 2022 when I started pursuing a new career as a software developer.
